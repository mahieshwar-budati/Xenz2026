# 🎯 EXACT Steps to Push Your Code RIGHT NOW

## ⚡ STEP 1: Create Personal Access Token (2 minutes)

### Open this link in your browser:
👉 **https://github.com/settings/tokens**

### Follow these steps:
1. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
2. **Token name**: Type `xenz-repo-push`
3. **Expiration**: Select "90 days" (or your preference)
4. **Select scopes**: Scroll down and check ✅ **`repo`** 
   - This will automatically check all repo permissions
5. Scroll to bottom, click **"Generate token"**
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately! It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - ⚠️ You won't be able to see it again!

## ⚡ STEP 2: Push Using Token

After you have your token, come back here and tell me you have it, OR use one of these methods:

### Method A: Push with Token in URL (Easiest)
I can help you push using the token directly. Just provide the token when ready.

### Method B: Use Git Credential Manager
Run this command in terminal:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
When prompted:
- **Username**: `mahieshwar-budati`
- **Password**: Paste your token (the `ghp_...` string)

## 🔄 Alternative: If You Can't Create Token

If you need someone else to give you access:
1. Contact the owner of `xenztechnologies-2026` organization
2. Ask them to add `mahieshwar-budati` as a collaborator
3. Accept the invitation
4. Then push normally
